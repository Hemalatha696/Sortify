# Sortify

Sortify is a Java-based interactive tool designed to demonstrate the functionality of popular sorting algorithms. With an appealing interface and intuitive controls, it helps users understand how sorting algorithms work through real-time visualizations.

## Features

- **Visualize Sorting Algorithms:** View Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort in real-time.
- **Adjustable Speed:** Use a slider to control the speed of the sorting process.
- **Pause and Resume:** Pause the sorting process and resume it later.
- **Stop Sorting:** Stop the sorting process at any time.
- **Dynamic Array Generation:** Generate arrays of various sizes with random values.
- **Complexity Information:** View time complexity details for each sorting algorithm.


## Algorithms Supported

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chauhan13/SORTING-ALGORITHMS-VISUALIZER.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd SORTING-ALGORITHMS-VISUALIZER
    ```

3. Compile the Java files:

    ```bash
    javac SortingAlgorithmsVisualizer.java
    ```

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    java SortingAlgorithmsVisualizer
    ```

## Usage

1. **Generate Array**: Enter the desired array size and click the "Generate Array" button.
2. **Select Algorithm**: Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. **Start Sorting**: Click "Start Sorting" to begin the visualization.
4.**Adjust Speed** Use the speed slider to control the animation speed.
5. **Pause/Resume**: Click "Pause" to pause the sorting and "Resume" to continue.
6. **Stop**: Click "Stop" to terminate the sorting process.
7. View Complexity: After sorting is complete, a dialog will appear showing the time complexity of the selected algorithm.
